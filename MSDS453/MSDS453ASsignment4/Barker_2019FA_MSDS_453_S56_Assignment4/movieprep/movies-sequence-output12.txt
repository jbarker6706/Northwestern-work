Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
No...
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
No.
You might wanna think about it
Who?
Joey.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You're welcome.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
It's just you.
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
No fear.
Who cares?
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
What?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
What?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Funny.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Just smack her now.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Just for now.
Yeah.
I'm likin' you guys better
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
Yes?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
You like it?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
He's really funny!
Really?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Sure.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Come where?
My office.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Yes, ma'am.
Young man, stop right there!
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Oh, brother...
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Do ya?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Eve? I'm leaving.
Are you French?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Here, pick these up!
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Oh, that's nice.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
It was amazing.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Do you own a car?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Nope.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Heck, no!  What?!
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Right.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
Okay.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Okay!  Damn!
No.
Thank-Q!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Sure.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
What?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Night!
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Two weeks.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
That's what I was afraid of.
Of course.
Thank you.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Sorry!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
I like it.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
What?!
Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Wow.
Good for you.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
Uh...yeah.
So, what are you seeing?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
That's boring!
Yeah.
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Okay!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I certainly do!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Look unimpressed.
Do I look crazy?
Yes!
Good-bye!
Not that one!
I like her.
And don't be so obvious!
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
How 'bout this one?
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Did you?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I'm really sorry!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Goodnight!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Is that what you call it?
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Sing it to me.
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
No.
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Neat. Goodnight!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
...I do.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
My mother's like that.
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
What?
Nothing.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Of course!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
How do I leave here?
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
I promise.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul»!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Shit is a French word?
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I think they have.
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
You nut!
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Really?  Since when?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
She's right?!
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1959.
Who use to own it?
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Yeah.
It's so small.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
True.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
No.
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
I LOVE THIS!!
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Oh. I see.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Does that work?
Yeah...Seems to.
Goodbye.
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
What?
Of what?
The hotel.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
My father is a genius.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Gladly.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Really? No kidding?
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, Mom!
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll go up.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Yes, ma'am.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
A psychiatrist?!
What?
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
What about relatives?
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Good.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Really?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No.  They all do.
I never know anymore.
Yes.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Yes, dear!
As long as we've got that straight.
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
To go up.
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Really?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
What shall we call him?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes.  Well... yes.
What?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Hi.
Coming!
You bet.
And I made these!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we did in my family!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
Sure.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes! That's right!
Mutants?!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
No.
Yes.
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
Excuse me.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
Amen.
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, yes.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Oh, my God...
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, that's blunt!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
What do you think, Adam?
I think...it...works.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
No.
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
What?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Where did he get all that information?
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
He didn't leave with them.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
You're goddamn right I am!
Coward!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What?!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I don't know. I like to think so.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
What?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Come on.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Where?!
Stop!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Um...uh...
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Stand by. One.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Roger, Wolf One.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
It'll just take a second.
You guys having fun?
Good. That's good.
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Bye.
I love you.
Bye.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
How's the trip?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Huh.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
So I guess that's it.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Gary.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Highliner.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You got it.
Say, is Maya working?
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
I'm good.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
They're just leftovers.
Is it chicken?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
That's what people say.
Stephanie.
Nice.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Oh yeah.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Not so bad yourself.
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Anything I'd know?
Maybe. Recognize this?
I am one of those guys.
You are not.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Well, in that case...
I can't help the traffic.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
You said you had it all lined up.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah, Conundrum.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Sure is tasty.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
What?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Um... seventy... something.
That's a good age.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
That's your problem, Miles.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I'd rather have a knife.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
I'm working on it.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
And Lexapro, yes.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
And get your bone smooched.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Let me call Christine.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
I owe her a call anyway.
Now we're talking.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
When do we get to drink it?
Now.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Want some?
Just a minute!
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Uh-huh.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
If that's what feels right.
It does. Feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
She is very hot.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
She works for tips!
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
How do you know?
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Shut up.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Fuck you.
So what's the plan today?
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Miles.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I want to go home now.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
What do you think?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
With Maya?
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Well, she is cute.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Aye-aye, captain.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Okay! Fuck!
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah. Okay.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Yep.
What're you drinking?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
With this chick.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Deep.
Understanding of what?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Yeah.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nope.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.
Thanks, Jack.
You're an asshole.
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Could be anything.
Been checking your messages?
Obsessively.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Shut up.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
I don't want to talk about it.
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
Is what the money thing?
With Maya.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Slaughterhouse.
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
What's happening?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
What exactly are we going to do?
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Huh.
Put me down, Jack.
No.
What?
It's private.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Let's leave it alone.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
I know what you need.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't have to.
I say we check it out. You never know.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Thanks.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
That's thoughtful.
Yeah.
Huh. Let me think.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's that?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
The plan is... you go.
Me?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Hold on.
Hrnrnrn?
That was quite a day yesterday.
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You're so negative.
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
I'll pay for it.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You need a new car anyway.
Whatever. Sorry.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Yeah.
Back at you.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
You were wearing your belt.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Sure.
I finished it.
Good for you.
The Windmill.
See you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I know. I love that.
That's what I'm having.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Hey.
She got anything good?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
Yeah, I know.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Is she sleeping or...?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, same here.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Yeah. Definitely.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
A paper?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Well...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
What about me?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah? Like what?
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Got it.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
Okay. See you around.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Goodnight, Miles.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
You too.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
About two-thirty.
Okay.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
What rehearsal dinner?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
I'm sure he believed every word.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Victoria.
Miles?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Ken.
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
That's great.
So how're you doing?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
So what's happening with your book?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
I am.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
I guess.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
See you over there, Miles.
Yeah.
About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
About a year.
French or American?
Both.
Good stuff.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Exactement!
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
He had to make a phone call.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Huh.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oops. Sorry.
You golf?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
What?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
I'll try to be more careful.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
No, I just meant...
Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
So you admit it?
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
You sent that?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
He implied it.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
What's he like?
Good-looking?
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
Loser? You?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Nah.
Never?
Well once. Mary.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
You're kidding? What did they say?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
His mother?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Amen to that.
What?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
Well think about it.
Uh-huh.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Yeah feels like it.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
I don't know what to say.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Check.
Mints?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
No.
I'm usually too tired to be.
Huh.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
People get hurt that way.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Who?
Mary.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Who?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
Call you back.
'That right?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
You got a brew?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Thanks.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Stalker, huh?
Big time.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Relax, he just ate.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
No I can't.
Am I?
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
You found my car?!
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
The sawbones?
Yep.
Dumbshit.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Ahh.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Thanks.
No thanks.
Nepal? Have you been?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Thanks.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Pat Healy.
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
It's right there on your golf bag.
Some buildings I'm working on.
Are you... an architect?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
What's that?
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
No, I mean
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
-- He's in a cage?!
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Great.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
A surprise?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
Deco.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Lint?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You're a movie buff?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Have you seen it?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
A fucking moron.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
-- Love story of our time.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Huh... that's strange.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Forget it. It was... fun.
Warren!
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Sure.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
All you want is a phone number?
Well, I know you're busy...
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
I don't buy it.
You don't buy what?
No.
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Really?  Very, very?
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
No, not at all.
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Oh my.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
She's in a wheelchair?!
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Uh, that's okay.
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Jai alai?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Good good.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Surprised?
What do you mean 'why'?
Answer the question, shitball.
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
You're a sick man, you know that?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Your turn?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
What?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Harvard?
You bet.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Among others.
Kim and I are close friends!
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
You mean him.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Who?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Bullshit!
And you met Mary how?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
How'd you manage that one?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Why you son of a --
Fucking sickening.
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
I never said that.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
What?
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
You were following us?
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
That must make it tough.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
'That right? Good for you.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
I'd go with the seven.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
How do you guarantee that?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.
No I'm not.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Ah, she's okay.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Meaning?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Good lookin'?
He's no Steve Young.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Healy.
Why?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Puffy, get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where's Puffy?
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Mary, the man's a killer.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Oh Jesus...
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Huh?
The prom -- you going?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Mary.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
You betcha!
Who's that?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
And did everything -- ?
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Really? I never got a message.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
He's dead.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Thanks.
Hm?
On your ear, you've got something.
Oh great, I ran out.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
What are you?
Twenty-two.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I agree there should be more.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
Yeah?
We've got a lot in common.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, sure.
Toy poodle!
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Mary, come on...
Go!
Okay.
You're Woogie?
You forgot your keys!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Really?
Really.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
I wish.
You got what stuck?
It.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Shhhhhh!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
What?! No please, sir --
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
I think a little of both.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
No, that's really unneces --
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
What do you mean?
I mean is it... is it...?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
I wasn't trying --
Is that bubble what I think it is?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
So what's up?
Eh.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Giddy-up.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Huh...?
Bye, Ted.
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Sorry, coach.
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Sure.
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Suck me...beautiful?
You need some work, buddy!
Like what?
...okay...
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
I'm not good in math.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Single malt?
Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
Neither did I!
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Seduce her.
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Neither will I.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
What?  No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Because I want to.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Onions?
What?
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Sure.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...yeah.
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
You called me Oz.
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
I know, it sucks!
Then don't.
Yeah right.
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Please.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
...I've never tried it.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
What?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Do you?
Of course.
Do you love her?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
I don't get it, that really works?
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You can crash at Stifler's?
It's all good.  Breath check.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Right.  That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Yeah, enormous.
Went home to shit.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
I'll save you a seat.
Just in time.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
That's stupid.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
He's going in!
Holy shit!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
She's already on a plane back home.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
You fuckin' rule!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
I'm not going.
Yeah.
Nothing!
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, well that about covers it.
It's not what it looks like!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Yes.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Dad!!
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Highly, highly overrated.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay, I get it.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Don't you want me to?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Okay!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
She's a mermaid, dude.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
C-Span?
No -- Kevin, you?
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
So do I, Kev.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I know.
After getting laid?
After high school.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
You've got something going?
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
I thought so.
Okay.
Me?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
I suppose that would be okay.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Strip?
Yes, slowly.
For me?
Move with the music.
Um...okay...
Nadia, I can't --
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Oh no.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You think so?
Kevin, this is serious!
You got in.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Tonight?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
How?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
That's my trick!
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Yes --
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
But you don't love me.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Okay.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
No...I know the perfect time...
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
I don't know.  How do you?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Okay.
I want to hear you say it.
Okay.
I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
It did.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Ready for what?
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
What?!  How do I do that?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Qualify for what?
You've just inherited The Bible.
What's that?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Observe.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
I don't care.
He didn't?
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Bullshit.  From where?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Dude, he does not.
Shut the fuck up.
Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
No shit.
Yep.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Doing what?
No way.
Huh?
You met the gift.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Go ahead.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
I want us to go out.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
I love you.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Uh-huh.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
I'm a waitress.
Since forever.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Me. My home number is on this card.
His home number.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
No.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
Okay.
I see the help -- judgement call.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
What do you care?
No.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
His name?
Spencer.
Okay.
Spence.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
How old are you?
Oh, please...
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
What's with the dark?
You all set here?
What are you doing here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
My son is sick, okay?
How do you know about my mother?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How ya doing?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Carol the waitress?
Yes.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
What needs clearing up?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
Yes.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Okay.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
What you did changed my life.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Lovely.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.
Now I want you to do something for me.
I want you to go on this trip.
No, sir...
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
The stiff one eye?
Two days.
I can't. I work.
You take off when you have to.
My son.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Is there another way to see it?
No.
Are you still coming?
Yes.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Welcome.
Nonsense!
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
No.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
Dancing?
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Okay.
Can we order first?
Fries.
One baked -- one fries.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Never.
Here's the trouble with never.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Sex with Simon?
It's one idea...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I'll never forget you said it.
It was a mistake.
To hell with sex.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
This one has a special meaning.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I'll take a bus.
I'll take you... why not?
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
The two might go together.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Cute.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Go ahead.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
So long.
Were you asleep?
What do you want?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Grouchy?
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
What job?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
What a break...
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I had to see you...
Because...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Okay.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
You know what? I...
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Yes. I really would.
Well...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
What a nice compliment.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Uh-huh...
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
How to die, mostly.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
Good night.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
All right, cut me a break.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
What are you trying to do to me?
What the heck do you mean?
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
You changed the room around...
Two years ago...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Yes.  No.
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
So am I, Frank.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Thanks for looking after him.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
He's a pain in the ass.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Okay by me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Do it.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Hey -- you called me... I...
About a dog.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Think white and get serious.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Last word freak.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
What?
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
Wait here.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Terrify me?
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Well, I can't reach them.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Absolutely.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Sure thing.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
What's he look like?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
How're you doing?
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
'Love was... '
Maybe this can wait.
Well, that's a load off.
Do you realize that I work at him?
No, I didn't.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Okay, then.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Verdell?
Thank you for walking him.
It smells like shit in here?
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Get out.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Get out.
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
Yo, yo, yo...
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Thanks.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Got any easier questions?
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Yeah...
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
Never a break. Never.
This stuff is pointless.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You consider your life easy.
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I'm going back with you.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Another place where?
Does it matter?
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
What are you talking about?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I love you.
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
I'm coming.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Because...  ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Did you like it that much?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
I forgot to lock the door.
What's it mean?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Please!! NO!!!
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
I should look different.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Something like that.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
I honestly wish I could...
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
Part of being a New Yorker.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
... weeks.
The wandering sportswriter.
Kindred spirits.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
He's still in love with you.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Desperate.  To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
No, he's ruining yours.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have a real philosophy of life.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
I can see why.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
When I'm talking to children.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You're butting in.
You like her.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
Go figure you.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
You've been working on this, huh?
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
And you believe that.
Sure.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Impressive.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
The man you love.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Someday she'll thank you.
Let's not get carried away.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
That was Thursday.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I can't even say it.
What do you suggest?
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Manicure...
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Needing.
To belong to someone.
And what will he do?
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Good girl.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Well, we're...
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
You need a few dollars.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
He said that, too.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
... except one.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
No.
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
I've missed a step.
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
Ju...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Gold nose hair clippers.
Hello.
Exactly.
Exactly what?
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
Only.  If he wants to.
He won't get mad, huh?
I just don't want to freak him out.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Don't you see...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
... that this is all my fault?
I love him.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
That's entirely understandable.
... unless he has a hump.
... look good on Kimberly.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I know Ben.
It doesn't say th...
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Well, somet...
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
You've met her parents.
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
... Thomas, yeh.
I need you.
W...
I can't wait for you to meet her!
Mirrors.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
What's next?
Endearingly absent-minded.
My very point.  Here's another one...
Quite the little eccentric.
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Firenze.
Till the gas ran out.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
What, leaving school...
... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
I got the point.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Boy, those were the days.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Never can tell.
Michael!!
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
No.  I've got you.
If you like.
Have you.
It's more than that.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Except for that.
Me either.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
The night we met.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Well.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Yes.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
That's my point!!
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
It means a lot.
... maybe it's congratulations.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
A bad combination.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Get married, apparently.
And your point?
Well.  How come she didn't...
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
She admits it's her fault.
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Well, it happens.
... yeah, that.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
Shhh.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
DON'T SPEAK!
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Lower.
Lower.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I came here, looking for her.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
That's little egotistical.
If you find her...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
The most important thing. Is being together.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Like family, huh?
To him.
... and you knew about this.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
What is that sup...
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
MICHAEL!!
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
An so it is.
You're much more his type.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Well, do you?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Nice.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Why do they listen to Guy?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Oh I know.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Thanks.
Sure. No problem.
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
It is?
Yes, it's lame.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Exactly.
ñ uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Right. 7:30.
I'm late for lab.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Oh. I forgot.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
No Roger from op/ed?
Nope.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
You're Pam?
If you say so.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Right. Right.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
What about the "Roaring Twenties"Ö or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Yeah.
You stood for like a month.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexyó  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Okay. That's bad.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
That is lingerie.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Bridgework?
Very romantic.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Anita!
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
Wings?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
Why?
Do I want to be crunched?
By Guy?
Betty.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Five-- Six--
Eh.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
A--flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Hey--I can be out of control.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Oh. Right.
Kristen got a quote?
Have you been there?
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
They hid my car--
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
OUT!
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
What if I say no?
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Are you in special ed?
Dude, you rock!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
My sword.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
You said that already.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
But I'm not a penguin.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Better person than I.
See!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Don't you remember what they called you?
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Good.
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Why is that impossible?
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Rob. Please focus.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Is that true?
Little known fact.
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
That's the spirit!
No. Josie, this is real.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
And a gymnast!
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
I know.
Really?
wasn't even thinking about-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I-
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Sure, why?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Oh I don't think so.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Thank you.
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
Thank you.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You remember that story?
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Don't look down!
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
I know.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Why do you do that?
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Oh--yikes!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Thanks. So do you.
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I just can't look at you the same way.
I finally found my story.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
I don't know.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That's what I'm saying.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We're very evolved.
Who are you guys?
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Duh.
Well, a ball player.
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh God.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Well... a shot at it.
I'm delighted.
Now you're lying.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh, stop showing off.
I'm not listening.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
And then I... right.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Well, they can be.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Fine.
Really?
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Here, let me help.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Really, no.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Thanks.  Well...
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Bye.
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Oh -- Okay.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Hello.
I brought these, but clearly...
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Absolutely fine about it.
And what happens next in the dream?
Yes.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Okay -- fine.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
I was.
Let's go in.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
You abide by rules like that?
Ahm...
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Step aside.
She left me.
Why?
She saw through me.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I don't know either.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
You've got to go.
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Your boyfriend?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I think goodbye is traditional.
Come in.
This is the place.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
A bath would be great.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Oh no no -- no.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well done you.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Eleven.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
With a goat playing a violin.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Yes.  Always have had.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No.  What's that?
Big feet -- large shoes.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Both.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Right.
Okay.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
What?
You and every person in this country.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Well...
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Who was Gilda?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Oh.
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Don't ask.
Undressed like this, yes.
Jesus.
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
You do?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
What's the thing?
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
And what would you say...
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Who is it?
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Rufus.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Anna Scott?
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
No!
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Don't even ask.
Right. 
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Do you want to stay?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes, I think that one may be.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Shame!
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
And we intend to use them!
Where's Bella?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Me?
Yes.  What do you think?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick!
It was good.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Blimey.  What's that?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Well, thanks, that's great.
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Right.
What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
The others?
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
This is Henry James film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Any bit in particular?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Who?  Someone famous?
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Not classic, no.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Can I help you?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
No -- did you?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Buggered?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
That's not fair.
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
Is it someone we know?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
May I help you, sir?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
No, no.  She doesn't.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
... can't let you through.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What are the choices?
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Point taken.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Good luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
You want me to write down all your messages?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
Absolutely not.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Which was?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Sort of.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Maybe.
And she's in your house.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Spike!
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Right.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Three.
Yes.
Oh.  Right.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Oh sure.  Of course.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
What book?
The one down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
Si.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Buona notte.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Why?
Because.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What's she doing?
What for?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Seriously.
No.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
No.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
--separate, in the evening..."
Yes.
Your hair... is perfect.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
You're sure...
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Let's find a telephone.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes.  We did.
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
What is it?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
What great aunt?
Oh no.  Do you?
No.
No...
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Except possibly that.
Dwayne?
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Sa dov'e' lui?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Ha un numero di telefono?
What's mezzaluna?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Okaaaaayyyy.
No.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
But, Faith--
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
But Faith--
What?...
Hi there...
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
My picture's up?
Thanks.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Amazing.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Non.  Please.
Hm.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Who's this?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
My name's 
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
That was before I found out what it was.
I'm in love with you.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
NO.
You are leaving, aren't you?
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Yes.
To the foot doctor.
Yes.
He's safe.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
What?
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So?
So it wasn't real.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Because I don't have the right name?!
Who says I don't love him?...
Because.  I know where he is.
Where's Positano?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Tell me.
I'd really rather not say.
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
NO.
Hi.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Oh.  That's nice.
Yeah.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
You too.
What?
Nice dress.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
I don't know if that's such a--
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
So were you.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
No.  Course not.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
No.  I just came by to apologize.
I know the feeling.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Well.  Congratulations.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Are you asking me out?
In that case... no...
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
There's no such thing.
What?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I can't believe you did that!
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Very funny.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Yes.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
There is no us.
I brought you that, too.
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
Just since yesterday.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Tonight?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
You would?  Really?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Really?
Really...
And more...
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
What?
Let's face it.  You want me.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
No.  He smokes.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Oh.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know.  I don't think so.
So?...
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
No.  He's never asked me.
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Yes you did.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I know...  It was.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
I know.  You're right.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
No...  I can just tell.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
It's a coincidence.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
You don't have a passport.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
My God, you have...
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
Maybe.
You're coming with me?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
What?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Are you sure?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
We lost him?...
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
What'd you find?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Oh.  Right.
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Nothing.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Sorry.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
You think he misses me at all?
'Course he does.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Polo.
Her brother.
Right.  My brother.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
What's she saying?
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Oh my God.  Where?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Is he looking at us?
Nope.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
What?
Good luck.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
And then what, Faith?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
I meant about my idea.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Men have ways.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
A little bad luck?
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What about Peter?...
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Who said I was going?
What?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
I'll be back before you leave.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Is Damon Bradley here?
What if he doesn't like me?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
My God... you're right.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
No one's perfect, Kate.
And he is living proof.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Yes.  He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
When you could've found one in America.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Uh huh.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Oh.
And Larry?...
What about Larry?
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Larry, did you rent a car?
Kate.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
A porco?
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
I'd love to.
Oh.
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
I thank you.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
But I do want to.
Giovanni.
Huh?
That's exactly what you are.
You miss me?...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
No, why?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
You said it differently then.
What?  You know him?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Went to high school with him. But...
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
He missed me.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
And you didn't tell her?
She didn't give me a chance.
She's not here.
Where is she?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Good strategy.
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
Mania.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
That's really romantic.
Ten billion to one.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Thanks.
Sorry...
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Got any last minute advice?
Maintain eye contact.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one!  Thanks.
It happens to be how I feel.
God bless you, Maggie.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Of course.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
His hair... any color.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
What?
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
No.  No, you didn't.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Where do you think she's going?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Or a vegetarian?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Poor Ike.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
I don't know.
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Why do YOU think she ran?
And you defending her?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, please!
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Oh, I will.
Tootaloo.
No, I'm not.
Are you a reporter?
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
That must have made you proud.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
-- The luau for Maggie.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Thank you.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
You know, your daughter seems...
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Originality is my speciality.
Excellent.
You'll answer my questions?
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Yes.
You have one?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Twice...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
A pre-wedding luau?
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
He is not!
You can turn that finger around.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Really.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Done.
Cindy the manicurist.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Still sweet.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
You don't know.
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Agreed.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Bob will be very happy.
Of course.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
No.  You take it.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Can you fix it?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Of what?
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Missed me bad, huh?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
Yes.
I don't and I don't think you should...
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Lost!
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
What!?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Yes I do!
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I'd rather not.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I kissed him back.
A little longer for me.
Really?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me, either.
I love you, too.
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
So, we'll...
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Yes, I did.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I'm listening.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Yup!
She's the boss.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Where?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Yes.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Would it?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
It's for the bell.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Not eight...
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Okay.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Quick.  Very quick.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Thank you, Dad.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Yeah.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
Thereís finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Exactly! Todayís my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Except itís Scotch.
But Iím not taking your name, buster. Iím a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Oh, shut up and be happy. Itís always this or that. Youíre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Drunk isnít the same thing as happy, Amy.
Bacardi 151.
Pub Golf?
The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I donít think I should be allowed to get married.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Donít worry about it.
But I do. I will. Youíre my sister.
What? Why? What do you mean?
Are you sure youíre okay?
Iím fine. I promise.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. Weíve been walking away our whole lives.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youíre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youíve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnít outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnít feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I donít know, but your misery just isnít working for me anymore.
Itís not me. I swear. Itís her. Sheís magic.
What for?
To make sure youíre okay.
Actually, I do.
Still--
If Ed ever found out....
Or Kat....
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Whatever you do, donít mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Your probably best off pretending youíre asleep.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Last night?
Why, with you.
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks itís--
Iím not as square as my daughter thinks.
Iím sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh, donít be that way.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havenít made up since.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now sheís getting married.
Thereís a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnít split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Mom, please.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnít just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
She did?
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Um, just about everyone.
You are taking the piss?
Itís been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Iím a hooker.
I had to say something to get you here.
Fair enough, but Iím stepping on toes here and youíre waltzing around like...
Donít be ridiculous. Itís late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Yeah, kind of.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Yeah.
What?
Thereís something about him thatís just a bit odd.
Other than, heís shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, thatís not it.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
And Kat was fully clothed.
But, somehow, it was Katís arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Thatís when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. Youíre an optician.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
And you do now?
Doesnít look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
You Yanks and your therapy. Itís great.  Itís all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
No, I canít. Weíre late for a dance lesson. I guess youíll have to finish up later.
Hello, Katmandu.
Yeah?
Hey, yourself.  I see youíve met my ex.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Iíd forget the rings.  I think Iím her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Maybe not her least... Thereís always--
I have regrets.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, thereís something not quite right.
Itís called character. God, youíre predictable.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Um, news flash: I donít give a shit.
Kat, stop it. You do. You canít even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, whatís your point?
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thatís a long time, isnít it?
Not for a dog.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Itís not supposed to be anything, Kat. Itís just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I donít know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
When we were together I was ìtoo here,î now Iím not here enough.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Itís no big deal. I promise.
Brilliant.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
I slept with your sister.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thatís why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Kat.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like weíre trying too hard to look like we fit.  Itís welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
You have feet?
Youíre funny.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, itís way better to look hot while youíre doing it.
Really?  Donít get too attached.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Both.
I donít do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in ìshare.î People do that.
Love.
He was pretty drunk, but I think heís still crazy about you.
Of course he is. Iím here with my new man.  I love it! Your magicís already working. Let the suffering begin.
I donít know.
What does your gut say?
Youíre too good for him.
Why?
Iím compulsive and weird?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youíre so cute, Iíll take care of our incidentals.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
That wonít be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Itís okay. Hell, Iíve never paid for it. But please donít feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
Iím desperate to start but I donít have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I canít get enough of.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Itís cute.
What is?
You stand on your tiptoes.
I do?
A weekend?
A wedding.
I think thatís disgusting.
Thatís right. Imagine facing it alone.
This happened to you?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your ìfriendî guaranteed my anonymity.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Shampoo, got it!
Oh, no.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnít be violated.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought Iíd respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
First of all, itís never out of the blue. And second of all--
What?!
When youíre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
I guess so.
What do you think?
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, ìLove Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.î Trust me, Iím careful.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Okay.
Oh, come on. Youíre like the Yoda of escorts.
I disappear. Itís not about me.
Show me.
Iíve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think itís the words: ìmorally repugnant.î
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Not dollars. Pounds.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
Yup. Thatís why you get to keep your money.
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnít one of them.
Itís my job.
Sure, but itís never easy. They say theyíre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyíre not.
So, whyíd you say yes to me?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Desperation?
Make out with you for free.
Spontaneously combust?
Yeah.
I didnít say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
So whatís with the nickname?
Youíve always got that to hide behind, donít you? Itís just business!
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, weíll go back to the real world and...and youíll be hiring me for your best friend!
Youíre judging me?! Oh, thatís a good one. Youíre lying to me, youíre lying to your family, and youíre lying to yourself. But youíre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youíll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
What?! No, no. You canít--
I have to.  Iím the best man.
Thank you.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Sure. Youíve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youíre easy.
I wasnít saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Therapist.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
You knew?
Iím so sorry.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youíre here for the highland flings, I bet.
I get all the glamour jobs.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
You pawned it.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Of course, donít be silly.
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
Ahoy!
Itís complicated, Dad.
Oh, well, then. It probably wonít work out.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Just drunk enough.
ì...but itís getting there. ì
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I havenít thought about that in years.
Hard.
Is there any other way to take it?
At least somebodyís using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nationís most precious resource: your daughter.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Will do.
