Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
No...
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
No.
You might wanna think about it
Who?
Joey.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You're welcome.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
It's just you.
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
No fear.
Who cares?
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
What?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
What?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Funny.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Just smack her now.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Just for now.
Yeah.
I'm likin' you guys better
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
Yes?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
You like it?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
He's really funny!
Really?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Sure.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Come where?
My office.
For how long?
Well, that depends...
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Yes, ma'am.
Young man, stop right there!
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Oh, brother...
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Do ya?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Eve? I'm leaving.
Are you French?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Here, pick these up!
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Oh, that's nice.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
It was amazing.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Do you own a car?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Nope.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Heck, no!  What?!
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Right.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
Okay.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Okay!  Damn!
No.
Thank-Q!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Sure.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
What?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Night!
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Two weeks.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
That's what I was afraid of.
Of course.
Thank you.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Sorry!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
I like it.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
What?!
Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Um-hum.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Wow.
Good for you.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
Uh...yeah.
So, what are you seeing?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
That's boring!
Yeah.
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Okay!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I certainly do!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
No it's not!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Look unimpressed.
Do I look crazy?
Yes!
Good-bye!
Not that one!
I like her.
And don't be so obvious!
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
How 'bout this one?
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Did you?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I'm really sorry!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Goodnight!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Is that what you call it?
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Sing it to me.
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
No.
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Neat. Goodnight!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
...I do.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
My mother's like that.
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
What?
Nothing.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Of course!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
How do I leave here?
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
I promise.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul»!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Shit is a French word?
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I think they have.
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
You nut!
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Really?  Since when?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
She's right?!
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1959.
Who use to own it?
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Yeah.
It's so small.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
True.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
No.
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
I LOVE THIS!!
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Oh. I see.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Does that work?
Yeah...Seems to.
Goodbye.
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
What?
Of what?
The hotel.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
My father is a genius.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Gladly.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Really? No kidding?
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, Mom!
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll go up.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Yes, ma'am.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
A psychiatrist?!
What?
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
What about relatives?
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Good.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Really?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No.  They all do.
I never know anymore.
Yes.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Yes, dear!
As long as we've got that straight.
To you maybe.
The locks.
The locks?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
To go up.
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Really?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
What shall we call him?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes.  Well... yes.
What?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Hi.
Coming!
You bet.
And I made these!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we did in my family!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
Sure.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes! That's right!
Mutants?!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
No.
Yes.
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
Excuse me.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
Amen.
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, yes.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Oh, my God...
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, that's blunt!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
What do you think, Adam?
I think...it...works.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
No.
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
What?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Where did he get all that information?
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
He didn't leave with them.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
You're goddamn right I am!
Coward!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What?!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I don't know. I like to think so.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
What?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Come on.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Where?!
Stop!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Um...uh...
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Stand by. One.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Roger, Wolf One.
Sorry.
No, it was good.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Sorry, coach.
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Sure.
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Suck me...beautiful?
You need some work, buddy!
Like what?
...okay...
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
I'm not good in math.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Single malt?
Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yes ma'am, I am.
Neither did I!
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
What are we gonna hear?
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Seduce her.
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Just go!
Why is this?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Charming.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Forget it.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Neither will I.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
What?  No I'm not.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Because I want to.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
How did you know I was here?
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Onions?
What?
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Sure.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...yeah.
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
I'm not playing.
You're missing the game for us?!
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
What's that?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
You called me Oz.
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
I know, it sucks!
Then don't.
Yeah right.
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Please.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
...I've never tried it.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
What?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
No.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Do you?
Of course.
Do you love her?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Are you kidding?  No.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
I don't get it, that really works?
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You can crash at Stifler's?
It's all good.  Breath check.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Right.  That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Yeah, enormous.
Went home to shit.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
I'll save you a seat.
Just in time.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
That's stupid.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
He's going in!
Holy shit!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
She's already on a plane back home.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
You fuckin' rule!
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
I'm not going.
Yeah.
Nothing!
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, well that about covers it.
It's not what it looks like!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Yes.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Dad!!
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Michelle.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Highly, highly overrated.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Okay, I get it.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
Don't you want me to?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Okay!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
She's a mermaid, dude.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
C-Span?
No -- Kevin, you?
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
So do I, Kev.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I know.
After getting laid?
After high school.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
You've got something going?
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
I thought so.
Okay.
Me?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
I suppose that would be okay.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Strip?
Yes, slowly.
For me?
Move with the music.
Um...okay...
Nadia, I can't --
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Oh no.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You think so?
Kevin, this is serious!
You got in.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Tonight?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
How?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
That's my trick!
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
You want to do it?
Yes --
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
But you don't love me.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Okay.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
No...I know the perfect time...
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
I don't know.  How do you?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Okay.
I want to hear you say it.
Okay.
I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
It did.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Ready for what?
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
What?!  How do I do that?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Qualify for what?
You've just inherited The Bible.
What's that?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I'm such a loser.
That's the spirit.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Observe.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
I don't care.
He didn't?
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Fuck yeah we will.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Bullshit.  From where?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Dude, he does not.
Shut the fuck up.
Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
No shit.
Yep.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Doing what?
No way.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Well, do you?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Nice.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Why do they listen to Guy?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Oh I know.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Thanks.
Sure. No problem.
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
It is?
Yes, it's lame.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Exactly.
ñ uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Right. 7:30.
I'm late for lab.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Oh. I forgot.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU KNIT?
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
No Roger from op/ed?
Nope.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
You're Pam?
If you say so.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Right. Right.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
What about the "Roaring Twenties"Ö or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Yeah.
You stood for like a month.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexyó  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Okay. That's bad.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
That is lingerie.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Bridgework?
Very romantic.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Anita!
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
Wings?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Transitioned?
You crossed over.
Why?
Do I want to be crunched?
By Guy?
Betty.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Five-- Six--
Eh.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You've done five of my ideas.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
A--flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Hey--I can be out of control.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Oh. Right.
Kristen got a quote?
Have you been there?
Uhh, no.
Have you been to any parties?
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
They hid my car--
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
OUT!
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
What if I say no?
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
He's my teacher!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Are you in special ed?
Dude, you rock!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
My sword.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
You said that already.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
But I'm not a penguin.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Better person than I.
See!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Don't you remember what they called you?
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Good.
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Why is that impossible?
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Rob. Please focus.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Is that true?
Little known fact.
Yes, desperately.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Better than I...
That's the spirit!
No. Josie, this is real.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
And a gymnast!
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Rufus?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
I know.
Really?
wasn't even thinking about-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I-
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Sure, why?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Oh I don't think so.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Thank you.
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
Thank you.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You remember that story?
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Don't look down!
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
I know.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Why do you do that?
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Oh--yikes!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Thanks. So do you.
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
But now you don't have to--
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I just can't look at you the same way.
I finally found my story.
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
I don't know.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That's what I'm saying.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We're very evolved.
Who are you guys?
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Duh.
Well, a ball player.
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh God.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Well... a shot at it.
I'm delighted.
Now you're lying.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh, stop showing off.
I'm not listening.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
And then I... right.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Well, they can be.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Fine.
Really?
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Here, let me help.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Really, no.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Thanks.  Well...
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Bye.
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Oh -- Okay.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Hello.
I brought these, but clearly...
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Absolutely fine about it.
And what happens next in the dream?
Yes.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Okay -- fine.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
I thought you were leaving.
I was.
Let's go in.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
You abide by rules like that?
Ahm...
What did you say?
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Step aside.
She left me.
Why?
She saw through me.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I don't know either.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
You've got to go.
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Your boyfriend?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I think goodbye is traditional.
Come in.
This is the place.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
A bath would be great.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Oh no no -- no.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well done you.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Eleven.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
With a goat playing a violin.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Yes.  Always have had.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No.  What's that?
Big feet -- large shoes.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
You have a stunt bottom?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Both.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Right.
Okay.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
What?
You and every person in this country.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Well...
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Who was Gilda?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Oh.
Stay forever.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Don't ask.
Undressed like this, yes.
Jesus.
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
You do?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Excuse me?
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Okay.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
What's the thing?
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
And what would you say...
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Who is it?
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Yes.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
Rufus.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Is that right?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Miracles do happen.
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Anna Scott?
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
No!
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Don't even ask.
Right. 
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Do you want to stay?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes, I think that one may be.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
What?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Shame!
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
And we intend to use them!
Where's Bella?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Me?
Yes.  What do you think?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick!
It was good.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Blimey.  What's that?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Well, thanks, that's great.
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Right.
What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
The others?
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
This is Henry James film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Any bit in particular?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Who?  Someone famous?
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Not classic, no.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Can I help you?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
No -- did you?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Buggered?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
That's not fair.
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
Is it someone we know?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
May I help you, sir?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
No, no.  She doesn't.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
... can't let you through.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
What are the choices?
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Point taken.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Good luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
So -- any messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Two?  That's it?
You want me to write down all your messages?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
Absolutely not.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Which was?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Sort of.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Maybe.
And she's in your house.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Spike!
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Right.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Three.
Yes.
Oh.  Right.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Oh sure.  Of course.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
What book?
The one down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
You don't understand this guy.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm not running.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Got any last minute advice?
Maintain eye contact.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Good one!  Thanks.
It happens to be how I feel.
God bless you, Maggie.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Of course.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
It's hurting.
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Sink the putt."
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
His hair... any color.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
What?
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
I already made an appointment for later today.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
No.  No, you didn't.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Where do you think she's going?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Or a vegetarian?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Poor Ike.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
I don't know.
You're coming here?
Yeah.
Then come for dinner.
Okay, we'll order out.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Why do YOU think she ran?
And you defending her?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Oh, please!
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
Oh, I will.
Tootaloo.
No, I'm not.
Are you a reporter?
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
That must have made you proud.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
-- The luau for Maggie.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Thank you.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
You know, your daughter seems...
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Originality is my speciality.
Excellent.
You'll answer my questions?
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Yes.
You have one?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Twice...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
A pre-wedding luau?
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
He is not!
You can turn that finger around.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Really.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Done.
Cindy the manicurist.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Still sweet.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
You don't know.
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Agreed.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Bob will be very happy.
Of course.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
No.  You take it.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Can you fix it?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Of what?
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Missed me bad, huh?
Excuse me?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
Yes.
I don't and I don't think you should...
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I already explained about that.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Lost!
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
What!?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Yes I do!
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I'd rather not.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I kissed him back.
A little longer for me.
Really?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me, either.
I love you, too.
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
So, we'll...
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Yes, I did.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
This is getting serious.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I'm listening.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Yup!
She's the boss.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Where?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Yes.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Would it?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
It's for the bell.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Not eight...
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Okay.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Quick.  Very quick.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Thank you, Dad.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Yeah.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
